We aimed to create a dashboard using data visualization techniques to show as many data insights as possible without making the dashboard too heavy to interpret. 
The final dataset used to create this dashboard is included in the file labeled moviedash.movies.csv.
The backend that handles the JSON data is included under the backend folder.

If you are interested in the process of how we reached our final dashboard, the changes, the initial visualizations, and other decisions you can check out the Process Book.

Once you go to the GitHub page it takes a minute for the page to load the data and it shows a loader but once all the data is received it functions smoothly.
